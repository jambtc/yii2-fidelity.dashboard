                <p>Payments are made directly to the blockchain system with no intermediaries resulting in little or no transaction fees and faster transaction speed.

The payment and finance sector is without doubt the flagship sector in which the blockchain is mostly used. In 2009 Bitcoin was born to allow direct and “trustless” payment network systems with the absence of a centralized body. Since its development, a plethora of projects have been born leading to exponential development in this effective and efficient transaction system of payments and transfers.
